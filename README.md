Push_swap (100/100) proper README coming soon.....

Keep in mind I used both my libft and ft_printf, however they are not present in this repository. Cloning and running "make" will therefore not work. 

I don't know how to create folders on github, okay? Don't judge. 

I also don't know how to remote access github repos from the school mac, okay? At least you have my code.
