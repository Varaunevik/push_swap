Push_swap (100/100)

Disclaimer:
I used both my libft and ft_printf, however they are not present in this repository. Cloning and running "make" will therefore not work. 

I don't know how to create folders on github, okay? Don't judge. 

I also don't know how to remote access github repos from the school mac, okay? At least you have my code.



[Here is a pdf presentation](https://github.com/Varaunevik/push_swap/files/14820863/Push.2.pdf) I made in order to better understand both the algorithm and they way we handle input. Hopefully it helps!
